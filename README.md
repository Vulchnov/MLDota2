To run the code go into the Code folder and run either
"python3 KNN3.py"
"python3 KNN5.py"
"python3 KNN10.py"
Depending on which value of K you want, that will create a txt file in that folder with the results of the predictions

If you move those txt files back to the main file and run "python3 results.py" 
The results of each of the knn will be printed out. 

The code is well optimized and the three of them can all be ran in parallel without problems, all three should complete in just over a day for the full 10,000 predictions for the dota2Test.csv
